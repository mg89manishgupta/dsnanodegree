## Project Description 

The project is being done as a part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. The objective of the project is to create a sucessful blog post baased on data analysis of datasets available on Internet. For my submission, I have used IMDB dataset for movies available on Kaggle and run data analysis to produce insights that answer key questions about movies uploaded at IMDB 

## Motivation for the Project 

I am a learning data scientist and was tempted to work on a real data science problem to get hands on experience. I am a movie buff myself and have fond interest in streaming movies on OTT over each weekend. My interest in movies clubbed with personal development helped me complete this project


## Summary of the Insights generated or questions I have been able to answer using data analysis

1. Top Movies - I have been able to find the top trending all time favorite movies on IMDB. I 
2. Top Director - I have been able to bring forward names of the greatest directors who enjoy top 3 positions on their work
3. Top Genre - from teh list of 1000+ movies, i have been able to summarise total movies available across different movie genres. Drama and Comedy lead the type of most number of movies available on IMDB
4. Top Movie based on user votes - Based on user votes and ratings casted for the movies, i have been able to idenntify top 3 movies
5. Running time for Movies - Also been able to decode average running time of movies. Ona n average most of the movies run for over 100 minutes
6. Movies distribution based on ratings - Most of the IMDB movies are rated betweem 7.5 and 8.5 . Certainly explains users trust and confidence in IMDB


## Description of various steps undertaken to complete the project

Project follows the CRISP-DM process/approach to problem solving.

1. Data Scouting - searching for the data available and building information about it
2. Data Gathering - making notes and collecting data available on internet
3. Data Ingestion - insourcing the datasets on your developement environment for data analysis
4. Data Assessment - looking at data to understand data quality issues
5. Data Cleansing - correcting data issues to maintain standards and confidence in results
6. Data Analysis - looking at trend analysis and performing statistical analsyis to generate insights
7. Data Visualization - represneting insights pitocrically for better user interpretation
8. Blog Creation - putting down your analysis in a non technical audience through a blog post posted on internet
